The current COVID-19 scenario needs no introduction. While everyone is giving their best to move forward, it is important to act responsibly and tackle this problem collectively. Today in many public places and in other gatherings, it has become common to screen individuals for body temperature, as a preventive measure to check for fever. The device that is used to do this is called a Contactless Infrared Thermometer. As many might have noticed, there is a huge surge in demand for this product, but it is not very hard to build one on your own which could not only serve its purpose but also provide more useful features than the commercial ones. Previously (long back before the outbreak) we have also built a handheld contactless IR thermometer gun, you can also check that out if interested.

So, the objective of this tutorial is to design a Low cost, Easy to build Contactless Thermometer that can measure body temperature, log them into an excel along with the picture of the individuals so that the record can be easily shared with concerned authorities.
